# ML is a subset of artificial intelligence
# ML is how computers learn from data to discover patterns 

# In supervised learning, the computer receives labels or output values, for the data. 
# In unsupervised learning, it does now. In Reinforced Learning, the model learns
# through corrections and consequences of its actions in the environment

# In ML, we have a flexible component, called A MODEL - The Model is being adjusted to
# the real world data through a model training algorithm ---> Trained model

# All ML problem solving needs three vital components:
## Machine Learning Model ### A generic block of code, used to solve different problems 
## Model Training Algorithm ### Makes small changes to the model to bring it closer to what we need to process
## Model Inference Algorithm


### MAJOR STEPS ###
# 1: Define the problem
# 2: Build the dataset
# 3: Train the model
# 4: Evaluate the model
# 5: Use the model

### DEFINE THE PROBLEM ###
# Be very specific
# Identify the ML task

#!# Hyperparameters are set before the training begins

### TRAIN THE MODE ###
# Hide 20% of the data to use for testing purposes (test dataset vs. training dataset)
# Loss function is codified of how close the model is to the goal
#
# Linear models (easiest, most used, fastest)
# Tree-based models (if/else tree)
# Deep learning model / Neural network structure
# # Simulate human neurons (simple computational units) connected
# # together by weights (mathematical representations of how much
# # information is allowed to pass through them). The process of
# # training involves finding values for weights
# # # # FFNN - Feed Forward Neural Network
# # # # CNN Convulational Neural Network (common in image processing)
# # # # RNN/LSTM Recurent Neural Networks and the related Long Short-Term Memory models 

# For classical ML: scikit-learn
# For deep-learning: mxnet, tensorflow, pytorch

# We can use the RMS (Root Mean Square) method to evaluate our model
## Kernel methods are used to modify the input of certain problems, as to fit a linear regression model
